### Main Vision

- Sell digital products and services
- I think there will be Products (blogs, personal websites, business websites, ecommerce and news platforms)
- There will be tech related services (like AI, CRM, Cloud, Digital Transformation, etc.)
- There will be more political related services (like campaign websites, digital strategy, etc.)

- And I think those will be almost all menus. 
- On the homepage, I want to benchmark above companies. I live how company like fantasy showed all their work in very cool way in each page
- When you scroll, you see one page at a time and it has video like contents and etc. 
  I want to choose those killer fonts, killer logos, ui, ux and everything
- Initially main selling point is news platforms, and websites, I want to generate cash as much as possible 
- And then I want to take on consulting like cloud and other projects. But they just take time to profit
- And same for CRM, marketing, political PR and etc. 

- But anyways, when someone visits our websites, I want them to feel like wow, this is really cool, and they want to work with us. 
- They would come for our products and stay for our services. Of course, they want to see what's their, but when they see our work, they would die for us. 
- And I want to make that happen. 
- Make this website like the perfect one!
